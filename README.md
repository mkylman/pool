# pool
  ST7793 TFT LCD and Arduino UNO Pool sim/game

no real game logic yet, other than balls can be sunk and if the cue ball sinks it resets

I feel like I mostly got the ball collision angles right, after a day or so of constant unexpected or undesired results.

Still having slight issues with shot power and gauging it

Friction seems close but maybe a little too linear or a little too strong. By friction I mean the amount ball power/acceleration gets decreased by every frame
